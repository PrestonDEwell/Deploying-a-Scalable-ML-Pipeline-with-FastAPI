## Model Details
* Model Name: FastAPI Maching Learning Model
* Model Type: RandomForestClassifier
* Model Version: 1.0
* Developed by: Preston Ewell, WGU
* Release Date: 1/11/2024
* Model Implementation Language: Python
* Framework(s): Scikit-Learn

## Intended Use
This model is intended to provide predictions on income levels based on age, class, 
level of education, marital status, etc. It is designed for use in applications where 
income classification is required, such as assessing eligibility for financial services, 
targeting marketing campaigns, or analyzing socioeconomic data.

## Training Data
The model was trained on a dataset obtained from Census Bureau Data, which contains 
information about individuals, including their demographic and employment-related 
features. The dataset was preprocessed to handle categorical variables, and label 
encoding was performed to convert the target variable into binary classes: ">50K" 
and "<=50K".

## Evaluation Data
The model's performance was evaluated on a separate test dataset, which was split 
from the original dataset to assess its generalization capabilities.

## Metrics
The following metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance:
* Precision: 0.7419
* Recall: 0.6384
* F1 Score: 0.6863

## Ethical Considerations
* **Data Privacy:** The dataset used for training and inference should not contain 
personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data. Proper privacy measures 
should be in place.

* **Bias and Fairness:** Care must be taken to mitigate bias in the model's predictions, 
particularly concerning gender, race, or other sensitive attributes. Regular bias audits 
and fairness assessments should be conducted to address any disparities.

* **Transparency:** The model should be transparent in its decision-making process, and 
users should have access to information about how predictions are generated.

## Caveats and Recommendations
* **Data Quality:** The model's performance heavily relies on the quality of the input data. 
It is recommended to regularly update and clean the dataset to ensure accurate predictions.

* **Feature Engineering:** Further feature engineering and selection may improve the model's 
performance. Experimentation with different feature sets can help identify which features 
contribute most to prediction accuracy.

* **Bias Mitigation:** Implement techniques for bias mitigation, such as re-sampling, 
re-weighting, or adversarial de-biasing, to address potential biases in the model's predictions.
